    <h2>1. Negotiation Fundamentals — The Art of the Fair Deal</h2>

    <p>Every Facebook Marketplace listing is the start of a conversation. Unlike retail stores with fixed prices, peer-to-peer marketplaces operate on a simple truth: <strong>the price is whatever two people agree on.</strong> Understanding this changes your entire approach.</p>

    <h3>Research Before You Message</h3>
    <p>The single most important thing you can do before negotiating is research. Search for the same item on Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist, and eBay's "sold" listings. Sold listings on eBay are especially valuable because they show what people actually paid — not what sellers wished they could get. This gives you a realistic range to work with.</p>

    <p>When you know the market value, you negotiate from a position of confidence. You can say "I've seen these go for $150–$180 locally" instead of just "that seems expensive." Sellers respect informed buyers, and you're much more likely to reach a deal quickly.</p>

    <h3>The Opening Message Matters</h3>
    <p>Most sellers receive dozens of "Is this still available?" messages. Many of those buyers never respond after the seller says yes. If you want to stand out, lead with a specific question about the item and include your offer or intent. For example: "Hi! I'm interested in the dining table. Is the surface in good condition? I could pick it up this weekend if we can agree on a price." This tells the seller you're serious, not just browsing.</p>

    <h3>Start Reasonable, Not Insulting</h3>
    <p>A common mistake is lowballing — offering 40–50% of the asking price right off the bat. This usually gets you ignored or blocked. A better approach is to offer 15–25% below asking price, which gives both sides room to negotiate toward the middle. If an item is listed at $200, opening at $160–$170 is reasonable. Opening at $80 is not.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> If a listing says "price is firm," believe it — or at least don't push hard. You can ask "Would you consider $X?" once, but repeatedly pressuring someone who's set their price will just waste both of your time.
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding Seller Psychology</h3>
    <p>Most people selling on Facebook Marketplace aren't professional merchants. They're regular people clearing out their garage, upgrading their furniture, or selling something they no longer need. They often have an emotional attachment to their items and a number in their head they need to hit. Your job isn't to "win" the negotiation — it's to find a price that makes both people happy enough to complete the transaction.</p>

    <p>Acknowledging the item positively ("this looks really well-maintained") before negotiating on price goes a long way. Nobody wants to lower their price for someone who seems to think their stuff is junk.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-card" id="etiquette">
    <h2>2. Marketplace Etiquette — Unwritten Rules Everyone Should Know</h2>

    <p>Facebook Marketplace doesn't come with a rulebook, but there's a strong set of unwritten norms that experienced buyers and sellers follow. Breaking these norms is the fastest way to get ghosted, blocked, or have a bad experience.</p>

    <h3>Respond Promptly</h3>
    <p>Time kills deals. If a seller responds to your inquiry, message them back within an hour if possible — especially for popular items. Marketplace moves fast, and many sellers operate on a first-come, first-served basis. If you say "I'll take it" and then disappear for two days, don't be surprised if the item is gone when you resurface.</p>

    <h3>Show Up When You Say You Will</h3>
    <p>No-shows are the number one complaint from Marketplace sellers. If you agree to meet at 3 PM at a specific location, be there at 3 PM. If something comes up, send a message as early as possible. Sellers who've been burned by no-shows often require buyers to confirm the day of the meetup — do this without being asked and you'll immediately earn goodwill.</p>

    <h3>Don't Renegotiate at the Meetup</h3>
    <p>This is a big one. If you agreed on $150 over Messenger, don't show up and say "Actually, I only brought $120." This is widely considered the most disrespectful move in Marketplace culture. The only exception is if the item is in significantly worse condition than described — in which case you should politely point out the discrepancy and offer to renegotiate or walk away.</p>

    <h3>Bring Exact Change</h3>
    <p>If you're paying cash, bring the exact amount. Asking a seller to break a $100 bill for a $35 item is awkward for everyone. Many sellers now prefer digital payments like Zelle, Venmo, or Cash App for this exact reason — discuss the payment method before meeting up.</p>

    <h3>Be Honest About Condition (Sellers)</h3>
    <p>If you're selling, disclose flaws upfront. Take well-lit photos from multiple angles, including close-ups of any wear, stains, or damage. Buyers who discover undisclosed damage at the meetup will either walk away or demand a lower price — and they'll be justified in doing so. Being transparent in your listing saves everyone time and builds trust.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Include measurements, model numbers, and the original retail price in your listing. The more information you provide, the fewer questions you'll get — and informed buyers make faster decisions.

    <h2>3. Staying Safe — Protecting Yourself in Person and Online</h2>

    <p>Buying and selling locally involves meeting strangers, often while carrying cash or valuable items. The vast majority of Marketplace transactions go smoothly, but taking basic precautions is essential.</p>

    <h3>Meet in Public, Well-Lit Locations</h3>
    <p>Police stations across the country have designated "safe exchange zones" in their parking lots — often with 24/7 surveillance cameras. These are the gold standard for Marketplace meetups. If that's not practical, choose busy public spaces like grocery store parking lots, coffee shops, or bank lobbies. Avoid meeting at your home, the buyer's home, or isolated locations.</p>

    <h3>Bring Someone With You</h3>
    <p>Whenever possible, bring a friend or family member to the exchange. This is especially important for high-value items (electronics, jewelry, vehicles) or if you feel even slightly uncomfortable about the transaction. There's no shame in having backup — most experienced Marketplace users expect it.</p>

    <h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>
    <p>If something feels off — the buyer is unusually aggressive, wants to meet in a strange location, or keeps changing the plan — trust your gut and cancel. No deal is worth your safety. Watch for these red flags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overpayment scams:</strong> Someone offers to pay more than your asking price and asks you to refund the difference. This is always a scam.</li>
      <li><strong>Shipping requests:</strong> A "buyer" wants you to ship the item instead of meeting locally, often offering to pay extra. On Marketplace, local pickup is the norm for a reason.</li>
      <li><strong>Fake payment screenshots:</strong> Always verify that money has actually arrived in your account before handing over an item. Zelle and Venmo payments should show in your bank or app, not just in a screenshot someone texts you.</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure to act fast:</strong> "I need this RIGHT NOW" or "I'm sending someone to pick it up" can be legitimate, but they can also be used to rush you into a bad decision. Take your time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Use the Messenger chat within Facebook Marketplace rather than giving out your personal phone number. If you do need to share a phone number, consider using a Google Voice number. Never share your home address in the listing — give the meetup location only after you've agreed on a deal and feel comfortable with the buyer.</p>

    <h3>For High-Value Items</h3>
    <p>When buying or selling expensive items like vehicles, electronics over $500, or designer goods, take extra precautions. For vehicles, meet at the buyer's or seller's bank so they can withdraw cash on the spot (or do a cashier's check). For electronics, test them thoroughly before completing the transaction. For designer goods, consider meeting at an authentication service or bringing a knowledgeable friend.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Take a screenshot of the buyer or seller's Facebook profile before meeting up, and share it (plus your meetup location and time) with someone you trust. It takes 30 seconds and provides a safety net.

    <h2>4. Communicating Across Language Barriers</h2>

    <p>Facebook Marketplace is used by people from every background and language community. In diverse cities, it's common to encounter listings in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Tagalog, and dozens of other languages. Language differences don't have to be a dealbreaker — in fact, some of the best deals happen when you're willing to communicate across the language gap.</p>

    <h3>Why Language Barriers Create Opportunities</h3>
    <p>Many buyers skip listings that aren't in their language, which means sellers in non-English-speaking communities often have less competition for their items. If you're willing to use a translation tool to communicate, you'll access inventory that most buyers ignore entirely. A family selling a beautiful dining set in a Spanish-language listing might get half the inquiries of an identical English listing — and be more willing to negotiate.</p>

    <h3>Using Pre-Written Phrases</h3>
    <p>For marketplace negotiations, you don't need fluent conversation skills — you need a handful of specific phrases. Questions about condition, price, pickup time, and location cover 90% of the conversation. This is exactly why we built <a href="/" style="color: var(--orange);">Haggly</a> — our phrase translator gives you instant access to common negotiation phrases in 18 languages, ready to copy and paste into Messenger.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Cross-Language Negotiations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep messages short and clear.</strong> Simple sentences translate better than complex ones. "Can I pick up at 5 PM?" translates more reliably than "I was wondering if perhaps we could arrange for me to swing by around fiveish?"</li>
      <li><strong>Use numbers and specific details.</strong> "$150, Saturday, 2 PM, Walmart parking lot on Main St" is universally understandable regardless of language.</li>
      <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> The other person is also working to understand you. Give them time to respond and don't assume silence means disinterest — they may be figuring out how to reply.</li>
      <li><strong>Send photos.</strong> A picture of the cash you're bringing, the meeting location on a map, or the item you're asking about can communicate more than any translated sentence.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn basic greetings.</strong> Starting your message with "Hola" or "你好" shows respect and immediately signals that you're willing to bridge the gap. Even a small effort goes a long way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When Google Translate Isn't Enough</h3>
    <p>General-purpose translators like Google Translate work well for simple sentences but can mangle slang, informal speech, and marketplace-specific terms. A phrase like "I'll do $200 OBO" might translate literally in a way that confuses someone unfamiliar with English marketplace slang. Using standardized, clear phrases — like the ones in Haggly — avoids this problem because each translation is crafted specifically for marketplace contexts.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> If you're communicating with someone in their language and they switch to English, follow their lead. Many bilingual sellers prefer English for business transactions even if their listing was in another language.

    <h2>5. Advanced Tactics — Getting the Best Deal Without Being Pushy</h2>

    <h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>
    <p>Items that have been listed for more than a week have higher negotiation potential. Sellers who posted three hours ago are firm on price; sellers who posted ten days ago are starting to wonder if they priced too high. Facebook Marketplace shows you when an item was listed — use this information. Similarly, sellers are often more flexible on weekday evenings (when they want to clear space before the weekend) and at the end of the month (when bills are due).</p>

    <h3>Bundle for Bigger Discounts</h3>
    <p>If a seller has multiple items listed, offer to buy two or three at a combined discount. This saves them the hassle of coordinating multiple meetups with different buyers, and most sellers will happily knock 10–20% off the total for the convenience. Frame it as a win-win: "If I grab the couch and the coffee table, would you do $300 for both?"</p>

    <h3>The Power of Cash in Hand</h3>
    <p>"I can come with cash today" is the most powerful phrase in marketplace negotiation. Sellers deal with a constant stream of flaky buyers, ghosting, and canceled meetups. Someone who is ready to pay right now, in cash, today, is worth a discount. Combine this with flexibility on pickup time and location and you'll consistently get better deals than buyers who haggle over every dollar but then take three days to pick up.</p>

    <h3>Know When to Walk Away</h3>
    <p>The strongest negotiation position is genuine willingness to walk away. If a seller won't budge to a price you're comfortable with, politely say "Thanks, I'll think about it" and move on. About half the time, you'll get a follow-up message a day or two later with a better offer. Even if you don't, there's almost always another listing for the same item. Patience is cheaper than overpaying.</p>

    <h3>Leave a Positive Impression</h3>
    <p>Marketplace communities are smaller than you think. Being polite, reliable, and fair builds a reputation over time. Sellers talk to each other (especially in buy/sell/trade Facebook groups), and buyers who are known for being respectful get first dibs on new listings. A $10 concession today might save you $100 tomorrow when a seller messages you directly about a great deal before listing it publicly.</p>
